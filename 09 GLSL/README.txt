09 GLSL
----------

An example of the video:opengl:filter component.  A webcam image is 
passed through a continually changing colour mixer.  

This example requires use of the OpenGL pipeline.  Switch this on in 
the video section of the options window (Tools / Options).  NB.  This 
pipeline is still fairly experimental!

The GLSL fragment shader can be edited live.  Note how the shader can 
make use of the parameters on the component.
