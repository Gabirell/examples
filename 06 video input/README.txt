06 video input
----------------

This project demonstrates how to capture video into a praxis patch, 
usually from a webcam. This function relies on the GStreamer library, 
so you must have this installed already on your system, or on Windows 
you can install the GStreamer plugin from the Praxis downloads page.

If you get an error about the capture device you either do not have 
GStreamer available, or it cannot find a webcam.

Again this project puts the video source through a code component to 
composite 2 animated rectangles over the top.
